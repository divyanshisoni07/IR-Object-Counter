# IR Sensor-Based Object Counter

## Overview
This project is a **sensor-based object counter** built on **zero PCB** using:
- **IR LED + Photodiode** for object detection
- **LM358 Comparator** for signal conditioning
- **NE555 Monostable** for debouncing and pulse shaping
- **CD4033 Decade Counter ICs** for driving 7-segment displays

It counts objects passing through the IR beam and displays the total on a 2-digit common cathode 7-segment display.

## Features
- Reliable counting with **debouncing via NE555**
- Modular design for easy debugging (test points available)
- Works in **low-light and indoor** environments
- Reset button to clear the count
- Powered from 6V supply with onboard 7806 regulator

## Working Principle
1. **Object detection** â€“ IR LED emits a beam to the photodiode. When an object blocks the beam, the photodiode voltage changes.
2. **Signal conditioning** â€“ LM358 compares the photodiode output against a reference voltage and outputs a digital signal.
3. **Debouncing** â€“ NE555 monostable generates a fixed-width pulse for each beam break to prevent false triggering.
4. **Counting** â€“ CD4033 increments the count on the 7-segment display.

## Assembly & Testing
1. Assemble the circuit as per schematic.
2. Power with 6V DC.
3. Align IR LED and photodiode for maximum sensitivity.
4. Test with objects moving through the beam â€” the count should increment.
5. Press reset to clear count.
